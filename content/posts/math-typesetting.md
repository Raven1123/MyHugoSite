## Type:

• Fire Force is a manga series that has been adapted into an anime.

## Plot Summary:

 Fire Force is set in a world where spontaneous human combustion has become a major phenomenon, turning people into deadly Infernals—fiery, monstrous beings. To combat this, special units known as Special Fire Force Companies are created. These teams consist of pyrokinetic individuals who have the ability to control fire and use it to fight against Infernals, with the goal of saving people and understanding the source of this phenomenon.

The story follows Shinra Kusakabe, a young man who joins Special Fire Force Company 8, a unique team made up of individuals with different pyrokinetic abilities. Shinra, known as the "Devil's Footprints" due to his ability to ignite his feet at will, has a mysterious past. His family perished in a fire 12 years ago, an event that left him falsely blamed for the incident. Now, as a firefighter, he seeks to uncover the truth about what really happened and to protect people from the Infernals.

As Shinra works alongside his quirky teammates—Maki Oze (a former soldier with fire abilities), Arthur Boyle (a knight-obsessed pyrokinetic), and Teppei (the company captain) among others—the team faces increasingly dangerous Infernals and uncover dark secrets behind the phenomenon of human combustion. They also confront the Evangelist, an enigmatic figure believed to be orchestrating the outbreak of Infernals.

As the series progresses, the Fire Force companies face deeper conspiracies, and Shinra’s quest for truth takes him to dark and fiery places, ultimately leading him to an explosive confrontation with the forces responsible for the chaos.
