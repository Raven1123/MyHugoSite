## Type:

• Solo Leveling originally started as a web novel and later adapted into a webtoon (manhwa).



## Plot Summary:

In a world where "Gates" randomly appear, linking the real world to dungeons filled with monsters, certain individuals known as "Hunters" are given powers to enter these Gates and fight the creatures within. Hunters are ranked by their abilities, and most of them are capable of extraordinary feats. However, there’s one hunter, Sung Jinwoo, who stands out for being weak and almost useless despite his rank as a "E-rank" hunter, the lowest possible rank.

Jinwoo’s life changes drastically during a mission in a double-dungeon. When his party is ambushed and most of them are killed by powerful monsters, Jinwoo is left behind, severely injured and on the brink of death. However, after a near-death experience, he awakens to a mysterious interface in front of him—an RPG-like system that shows him statistics, quests, and the ability to gain experience and level up, much like a character in a video game.

This ability is referred to as the "System," and Jinwoo realizes that he can now level up in a way that no other Hunter can. Unlike others who are stuck with their innate abilities, he can increase his strength by completing quests, fighting monsters, and growing stronger with each battle. In the beginning, Jinwoo is cautious and keeps his newfound powers a secret, fearing what might happen if others find out. But as he faces increasingly powerful opponents and challenges, his strength grows exponentially.

As Jinwoo ascends in power, he encounters more dangerous and powerful beings, including S-Rank hunters, otherworldly entities, and ancient beings tied to the Gates. He also discovers that the Gates and the monsters within them are part of a much larger and darker mystery involving a secret organization, the true nature of the System, and the hidden motives of powerful figures from both the human and monster worlds.

The deeper Jinwoo delves into his newfound powers, the more he uncovers about the greater forces at play. Eventually, Jinwoo’s power leads him to confront beings far beyond what any Hunter could comprehend, including the Monarchs and the Rulers, entities involved in an ancient conflict that shapes the fate of the world.

Jinwoo also forms strong relationships with other Hunters, some of whom aid him in his quest to protect the world, while others may have their own agendas. Throughout the story, he faces difficult moral choices and discovers the true cost of his power. Ultimately, Jinwoo's journey is not just about leveling up and becoming the most powerful Hunter in the world but also about learning what it truly means to be a hero.

As he grows stronger, Jinwoo's ultimate goal becomes not just survival, but to take control of his fate, protect those he cares about, and confront the hidden forces threatening humanity's existence.
