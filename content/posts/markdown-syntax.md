## Type:

• Kaiju No. 8 is a manga series that is being adapted into an anime.

## Plot Summary:

Kaiju No. 8 is set in a world where gigantic monsters called "Kaiju" regularly threaten humanity. To combat these terrifying creatures, the government has established an elite military force known as the Defense Force, specifically trained to fight and eliminate Kaiju.

The story follows Kafka Hibino, a man in his thirties who has always dreamed of becoming a member of the Defense Force, like his childhood friend, Raito Igata, who is now a top-ranking officer. However, Kafka is stuck in a lowly position as a cleaner, tasked with cleaning up the remains of defeated Kaiju after the battles. Despite his efforts, he can't escape the ridicule of being an unimportant member of society.

One day, after a disastrous battle with a Kaiju, Kafka is unexpectedly turned into a Kaiju hybrid after coming into contact with the remains of one of these monsters. As a result, he gains the ability to transform into a powerful Kaiju with immense strength and regenerative abilities. Now, Kafka must navigate his new powers while attempting to join the Defense Force as a soldier without revealing his secret identity.

As Kafka grapples with his new monstrous form, he must face increasingly powerful Kaiju, avoid being discovered, and figure out a way to use his new abilities for good while still trying to achieve his dream.
