• Sakamoto Days is a manga series that has been adapted into an anime.

## Plot Summary:

Sakamoto Days follows Taro Sakamoto, a former legendary assassin who was known for his incredible skills and fearsome reputation in the underworld. However, after meeting his wife and starting a family, Sakamoto decides to retire from his dangerous life as a hitman and live peacefully.

Now, Sakamoto is a middle-aged, overweight man who runs a convenience store, living an ordinary life with his family. Despite his change in lifestyle, he retains all the deadly skills he once possessed. His store, though seemingly mundane, attracts attention from dangerous individuals in the criminal world who don't realize his true identity. Sakamoto finds himself dragged back into the world of assassination, not because he seeks it, but because of his loyalty to his family and friends.

Alongside Sakamoto, his old colleagues and a group of unlikely allies, including Shin, a young man who becomes his employee and proves himself a valuable aide, are drawn into increasingly absurd and dangerous situations. The series blends action, humor, and heartfelt moments as Sakamoto tries to balance his past as a skilled assassin with his new life as a family man, all while protecting those he cares about.
