## Type:

• Hell's Paradise (Japanese: Jigokuroku) is a manga series that was adapted into an anime.



## Plot Summary:

Hell's Paradise follows Gabimaru, a ruthless and powerful shinobi (ninja) who has lost his will to live. However, after being captured and sentenced to death, he is offered a chance at redemption. The government sends him on a mission to a mysterious, dangerous island known as "Hell's Paradise" in search of the elixir of life, a mythical substance that can grant immortality. This island is said to be full of strange creatures, deadly traps, and terrifying supernatural forces.

Gabimaru is paired with Yamada Asaemon Sagiri, an executioner who is tasked with ensuring his survival on the island. However, Sagiri’s role is not just to guard him; she has her own motivations tied to her duty as an executioner and her personal desires to prove herself.

The island is home to many criminal convicts who are given a second chance to gain freedom by retrieving the elixir. Gabimaru and the others face off against monstrous creatures, treacherous environments, and even each other, while uncovering secrets about the island, the mysterious power at work, and the immortality they’re all after.

Gabimaru’s journey becomes not only one of survival but also of redemption, as he learns to confront his own emotions, his past, and his desire for a peaceful life. Meanwhile, the dark and twisted nature of the island, filled with horrors beyond imagination, forces him and others to question what they’re truly fighting for.
